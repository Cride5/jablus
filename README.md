# Dairy Farm Simulator

A whole dairy farm simulator, driven by scientific crop and animal models


## Instructions
To get the simulator up and running:
1. Download the program at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cride5/jablus/master/dist/jablus-1.0.jar
2. Double click on jablus.jar to start the simulator
3. If it won't start, make sure the Java Runtime Environment is installed on your computer. It
can be downloaded here: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

Once the program is running you can
* Manage Livestock
  1. Buy or sell them (market tab on left)
  2. Buy or sell feeds for the livestock (market tab)
  3. Assign feeds offered to cows – in kg/cow (livestock tab on left)
  4. Manage percentage of heifers and cows confined (livestock tab)
* Manage Crops
  5. Sew grass, maize or wheat (right click over field)
  6. Assign grass fields for grazing
  7. Harvest grass for silage, or wheat/maize for fodder
  8. Plough fields
* Move on to next month (Next button on bottom right)

These visualisations provide feedback on what's going on:
1. Stores of cattle, feeds and manure (top)
2. Map of fields (crop-type, expected yield, soil water, soil nitrates, nitrate leaching)
3. Weather graph and balance graph (right)
4. Balance Sheet (market tab)
5. Time - conspicuously hidden under the bottom left of the map!Dairy Farm Simulator 


## Improvements
There are a lot of things which could be improved upon with this simulator. These are a few things
which come to mind:
* Help
  - Detailed web-based instructions
  - Initial pop-up to explain the scenario
  - Tool tips to explain buttons and visuals
* Livestock Management
  - A visualisation to show the herd in more detail, with info on the age of the animals and the
lactation number/stage
  - Information on how much offered feed is being consumed to help in choosing an
appropriate diet
* Crop Management
  - Ability buy/sell fertiliser and apply it to fields
  - Ability to apply manure to fields
  - Keys on the map visualisations
* Farm management
  - Ability to buy extra buildings (storage space)
  - Information on how well the farm is running
    * Pollution (Nitrate leaching, wasted manure)
    * Environmental Friendliness (set aside land, lower fertiliser use)
    * Productivity (animals, milk, crops)
    * Level of self sufficiency
* Market
  - Show graph of changing buying and sale prices of feeds, fertilisers, cattle and milk
  - how pop-up summarising financial performance at end of year
* Time
  - Time-line showing how far through the simulation we are and what year/month it is
* Weather
  - Instead of the graph given, a wee bar at the top showing a BBC-style 5-day forecast
* Decision-Making
  - Ability to input any number of decisions/reasons for each round
